                    <p>If we have a lot of stuff, we will have a lot on our mind. Maybe we will have a lot of debt because we buy all that stuff, and now we have to manage all that stuff. It requires maintenance and organization. Itâ€™s not like we buy it and we are done with it. If you relieve yourself of that burden of ownership, most people report feeling a lot better and freer. Hence, buy less, choose well, make it last. </p>

                    <p>Have you ever hiked before in your lifetime? 
                        Hiking not only brings advantages for humans, it also benefits nature. Hikers can prevent the piles of rubbish from becoming an eyesore and emitting a foul stench. Get off on your phone, start your hiking journey ASAP! 
                        Although we cannot hike during this pandemic, we can still plan for hiking after the pandemic. Do you know there are many hiking trails in Malaysia? 
                        Broga Hill, Gasing Hill, Mount Kinabalu, Penang Hill and so on are some of the good places to hike. 
                        Take your time and do research on what is the most suitable hiking trails for you and your loved ones. </p>

                    <p>There are many reasons why we should cook our own meals at home. Cooking more often not only allows you to source sustainable ingredients, waste less food,
                        and use less energy, but a home cooking, especially a diet rich in plants, means less impact on the environment.</p>

                    <p>There are many reasons why we should reduce the amount of meat and animal products we consume. If we decide to eat fewer meals with meat or dairy each week, we can have a huge
